                    I am Arav Kumar, an AI researcher dedicated to advancing the field of artificial intelligence. My journey in AI began with the development of the Gated Memory Unit, which sparked my interest in exploring novel approaches to machine learning and neural networks. Since then, I've expanded my research into various domains, always with the goal of pushing the boundaries of what's possible in AI.

                    In the realm of fundamental physics, I've been working on applying causal AI to low-level particle dynamics. This interdisciplinary approach seeks to uncover new insights in particle physics by leveraging advanced AI models to identify causal relationships that might be overlooked by traditional methods.

                    My current focus is on developing signal processing methods for dense white noise decoding. This cutting-edge research aims to uncover patterns and information in what appears to be random noise, potentially opening new avenues for approaching general intelligence in AI systems.
